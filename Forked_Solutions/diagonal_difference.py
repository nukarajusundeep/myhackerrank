"""
Given a square matrix of size N Ã— N, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

Input Format:

The first line contains a single integer, N. The next N lines denote the matrix's rows, 
with each line containing N space-separated integers describing the columns.

Output Format:

Print the absolute difference between the two sums of the matrix's diagonals as a single integer.

Sample Input:

3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12

Sample Output:

15
