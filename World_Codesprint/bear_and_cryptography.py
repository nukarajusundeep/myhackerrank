"""
Limak is a little bear who loves school. Today was his first lesson in cryptography, 
and the teacher assigned some difficult homework - to find any number with exactly K divisors. 
Limak wants to go the extra mile and find the biggest possible number; however, his 
teacher explained that there are arbitrarily large numbers with this property.

To give this little bear a more achievable challenge, the teacher advised him to consider only numbers not greater than N.

Given N and K, what is the largest number Limak can find?

Input Format:

The first line contains an integer, T (the number of test cases). 
The T subsequent lines of test cases each contain two space-separated integers, N and K, respectively.

Constraints: 

1 <= T <= 50
1 <= N <= 10**12
1 <= K <= 40

Output Format:

For each test case, print the biggest number Limak can find on a new line. Print âˆ’1 if no such number exists.

Sample Input:

3
15 3
15 4
15 5

Sample Output:

9
15
-1
